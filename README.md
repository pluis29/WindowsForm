## Introduction

This is my first project using **`Windows Forms with C#`**, where I explored various methods to create a user interface. The project began with an application that used local storage with files and later transitioned to a database using *SQL Server*, experimenting with both *NoSQL* and *Relational database*.

The goal was to create a **CRUD** application to **register**, **delete**, **search**, and **update** a client.
